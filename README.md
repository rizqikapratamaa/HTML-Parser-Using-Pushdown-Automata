## General Information
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) serves as a markup language utilized in shaping the structure and visual presentation of web content. Through elements (tags), HTML organizes and groups content. Similar to most languages, HTML maintains its own syntax for writing, the violation of which can lead to errors. An error detection program for HTML is essential to verify the accuracy of tag usage and its associated attributes.

###
This program also has an additional feature, namely telling you where the error in the HTML code entered. The program can also explain what expressions are wrong in the program, such as inappropriate use of tags or attributes. The program can also detect errors involving the HTML program code structure.
